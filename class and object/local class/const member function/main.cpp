if a member function does not alter any data in the class then we may declare it a member function 

void mul(int,int)const;
double getbalance() const;

local class 

void test(int a){//function
    
    
    class student{//local class
        
    };
    
    student s1(a);//create student object use student object
}
they cann not have static data member and member function must be defined inside the locl class
